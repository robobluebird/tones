# tones

a web app for creating small computer musics and sharing them with others. wip.

live @ quickloops.net

## install

- Have Ruby, sox (for mp3 creation), and sqlite3
- `clone https://github.com/robobluebird/tones`
- `cd tones && bundle`
- `ruby tones.rb`

## current events

I am focused on making the app and adding features that I think are fun and interesting. If anything comes of it then testing/JS bundling/frameworking can come later. If you really enjoy that sort of thing then by all means :)

## Thanks
